Data wrangling with mongodb

This folder contains submitted code & writeup for Udacity Data Analyst Project 3: Data Wrangling with MongoDB (July 2015 cohort).

The project takes an OpenStreetMap extract from the Syria region, converts it to JSON format, imports it into mongoDB, and calculates: 
q1 = 'Total number of streets'
q2 = 'Total number of streets with arabic names only'
q3 = 'Total number of streets with english names only'
q4 = 'Total number of streets with both arabic and english names'
q5 = 'Total number of streets with names in other languages'
