In a 10-year dataset from peer-to-peer lender Prosper Loans, loans that failed within the first 10 months generated APYs ranging from -100% (total loss) to more than +75%. Why would both the best and worst performing loans be associated with the earliest closing dates? This analysis investigates the drivers of annualized percentage yield (APY) and uses real-world data to illustrate the basic intuition behind the results of early loan termination. Predicted yields based on financial formulas are compared with the data through exploratory visualizations, regression analysis and questions-and-answers. 

This analysis was the final project for Udacity's Data Analysis With R course, completed in November 2015.
