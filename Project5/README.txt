This project aimed to identify persons of interest (POIs) in the Enron corporate fraud scandal by using supervised learning techniques on a public Enron email database. The analysis utilized sklearn's Lasso function to select the most significant input features, then tested the predictive performance of five different machine learning algorithms: GaussianNB, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K Nearest Neighbors. The best performing model achieved an average precision score of 0.41 and an average recall of 0.53.

This analysis was the final project for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning course, completed in January 2016.
